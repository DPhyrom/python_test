Hello and welcome! Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I truly appreciate your interest and would love to hear your feedback. ðŸ˜Š

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DPhyrom/python_test.git

2. **Create a virtual environment** To ensure all dependencies are isolated, create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv

3. **Activate the virtual environment** If you are using Windows:

   ```bash
   .\myenv\Scripts\activate

4. **Install required dependencies** Use pip to install all the modules listed in requirements.txt:

   ```bash
   pip install -r .\requirements.txt


5. **Jump into product folder**

   ```bash
   cd .\production\

6. **Run the server** Start the development server with the following command:

   ```bash
   python .\manage.py runserver

## Demo
Once the server is running, you can access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
